# Show Your Work! and Reproducible Science

Why make everything public?

* In the past, the paper was the science. Now it's code too!
* The code is so complicated- you can't describe it simply in a paper! 
* The version of the code you use is important.
* Helps with peer review?? 
* It makes everyone's life easier- e.g. people who are doing similar analyses. It would save a lot of people a lot of time!
* It's better for you looking back in months/years time.
* The things you learn by making your research reproducible will help you in the future.
* Equations and algorithms aren't enough for me to reproduce your work- writing the code is hard work!
* Easier to peer-review the code? See the JOSS.

Why might you not do this?

* It's lots of work! Is there a payoff??
* Sometimes it's unclear how to automate things in practice.
* Sometimes your data is proprietary or can't be made public. 
* The size of the data can be an issue- what if I need 100s of Gbs of data to make the plot? What if I need 10 hours of supercomputer time to reduce the data?
    * Response- we often don't directly plot 100s of Gbs of data directly- can you release an intermediate step/product/etc?
* Nebulous ownership of code, and proprietari-ness of stuff attached to people who might leave the field. 
* Might be useful to have many different people solving the same problems (e.g. catching bugs).

Misc:

* Quarto is great! Can make various kinds of documents with inline code/etc.
